# Automated Class Schedule Generator [live](https://schedulegene.netlify.app/)
  A React-based application that allows users to automatically generate and manage class schedules. The app provides tools for users to input scheduling parameters, generate conflict-free schedules, and manually      customize them if necessary. It also supports persistent schedule storage using local storage, ensuring that data remains available even after page reloads.

## Features
  1. üîÑ Automated Schedule Generation
      * Users can input classes with details like subject, required semester hours, professor name, and preferred time slots.
      * The app ensures that there are no scheduling conflicts by checking professor availability and optimizing time slots for each class.
      * Users can generate schedules either for individual classes or in bulk for multiple classes.
  2. ‚úèÔ∏è Schedule Customization and Manual Overrides
      * Users can manually override the auto-generated schedule to make changes.
      * The system highlights potential conflicts such as professor double-booking or unavailable rooms.
      * Any modifications are validated against the original parameters to ensure compliance with scheduling rules.
  3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflict Resolution
      * Automatically detects scheduling conflicts (e.g., a professor booked for two classes at the same time).
      * Provides users with options to manually resolve conflicts or let the system suggest alternative schedules.
4. Student View (Optional)
      * A simple, read-only view for students to access finalized class schedules.
